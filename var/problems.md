Markup:
1. save to library button on product covers in not done
2. class "comics" doesn't exist though is used in _index.php
3. top (search) panel leaves screen borders when zoomed in and it won't horizontally scroll, so the elements are unaccessable.
4. users can open or download images.
5. filter buttons don't resize

Overall:
2. no url forwarding
